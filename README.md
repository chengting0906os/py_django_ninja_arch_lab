# py_django_ninja_arch_lab

## This repository is a lab for **Clean Architecture**, **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, and disciplined testing (TDD/BDD).

It implements Clean Architecture via a hexagonal (ports & adapters) structure: **driving adapters** handle inbound requests (Django Ninja Extra controllers), while **driven adapters** connect to outbound dependencies (Django ORM repositories, external services).

## Clean Architecture Overview

```
src/
â”œâ”€ domain/           # Core business model: aggregates, entities, value objects, domain events
â”‚                    # pure business logic
â”œâ”€ app/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ interface/     # Ports (abstract contracts/interfaces) defining dependencies
â”‚  â””â”€ use_case/      # Application services orchestrating domain/business workflows via those ports
â”‚
â”œâ”€ driven_adapter/   # Outbound adapters implementing app interfaces
â”‚                    # (repositories, external APIs, message queues)
â”‚
â”œâ”€ driving_adapter/  # Legacy FastAPI inbound adapters (kept for reference during migration)
â”‚
â””â”€ platform/         # Django platform: settings, session auth, logging, Ninja controllers
```

## Domain Layer Overview

```
src/domain/
â”œâ”€ aggregate/       # Aggregate roots (OrderAggregate manages invariants & events)
â”œâ”€ entity/          # Entities (Order/Product/User with attrs + validators)
â”œâ”€ value_object/    # Immutable snapshots (BuyerInfo, ProductSnapshot, etc.)
â”œâ”€ enum/            # Domain enums (OrderStatus, ProductStatus, UserRole)
â””â”€ domain_event/    # Events describing state changes (OrderCreatedEvent, etc.)
```

## Simple Shopping Platform Scope

**User Stories**

- **Authentication**

  - As a visitor, I can register as seller
  - As a visitor, I can register as buyer
  - As a user, I can login
  - As a user, I can logout

- **Seller**

  - As a seller, I can create product
  - As a seller, I can manage stock
  - As a seller, I can view sales

- **Buyer**
  - As a buyer, I can browse product
  - As a buyer, I can buy product
  - As a buyer, I can make payment
  - As a buyer, I can view my orders

Features are intentionally lightweight; focus on the architecture patterns.

### Current Migration Status

- âœ… Django project scaffolded under `src/platform`
- âœ… User module running through Django Ninja Extra with session authentication
- ðŸ”„ Product & Order controllers pending migration from FastAPI
