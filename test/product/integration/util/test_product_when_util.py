"""When helpers for product integration tests."""

# Currently no shared when helpers
# Each test class defines its own when helpers specific to the action being tested
# For example:
# - test_product_creation.py has _when_create_product
# - test_product_update.py has _when_update_product
# - test_product_list.py has _when_request_seller_products and _when_request_available_products
